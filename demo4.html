				Hey, Uncle Father Oscar. Everybody dance NOW. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Did Ted make an appointment?
